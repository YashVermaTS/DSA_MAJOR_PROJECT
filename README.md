# Pacman Maze Solver

A C++ application that generates random mazes and solves them using different graph algorithms to find the optimal path. This project demonstrates and compares the efficiency of various pathfinding algorithms through visualization.

## Overview

The Pacman Maze Solver generates random 20Ã—20 (or configurable size) mazes with multiple possible paths to the destination. It then solves these mazes using different graph traversal algorithms, visualizes the paths, and provides performance metrics for comparison.

## Features

- **Random maze generation** with configurable dimensions
- **Multiple path generation** (2-4 paths) to enable meaningful algorithm comparison
- Implementation of four different pathfinding algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - A* Search
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Visualization** of maze and solution paths using SFML
- **Performance metrics** for each algorithm:
  - Execution time
  - Path length
  - Number of nodes visited

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `maze.h`: Defines the Maze class and Cell structure
- `maze.cpp`: Implements maze generation and path creation algorithms
- `maze_solver.h`: Defines the MazeSolver class and Point structure
- `MazeSolver.cpp`: Implements the pathfinding algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, Dijkstra)
- `MazeVisualizer.h`: Defines the visualization interface
- `MazeVisualizer.cpp`: Implements the maze and path visualization using SFML
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program logic and algorithm comparison functionality

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- SFML 2.5 or higher
- CMake 3.10 or higher

## Building the Project

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a build directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. Configure with CMake:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Running the Application

The application can be run in two modes:

### Visualization Mode (default)

```bash
./pacman_maze_solver
```
### comparison Mode 
``` bash
./pacman_maze_solver compare [num_trials]
```

## Implementation Details

### Maze Generation

The maze is generated using a randomized depth-first search algorithm (recursive backtracker), which creates a perfect maze with exactly one path between any two points. Additional paths are then added by randomly removing walls to create multiple possible routes to the destination.

### Pathfinding Algorithms

All algorithms start at the top-left corner (0,0) and aim to reach the bottom-right corner (width-1, height-1):

- **DFS**: Uses a stack to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- **BFS**: Uses a queue to explore all neighbors at the present depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level
- **A\***: Uses a priority queue with a Manhattan distance heuristic to guide the search
- **Dijkstra**: Similar to A* but without a heuristic, finding the shortest path in terms of steps

### Visualization

The maze and paths are visualized using SFML:

- Walls are drawn as black lines
- The start point is marked in blue
- The goal point is marked in red
- The solution path is highlighted in green

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the project include:

- Adding weighted paths to better demonstrate the advantages of A* and Dijkstra
- Implementing additional maze generation algorithms
- Adding step-by-step visualization of the pathfinding process
- adding adversaries
